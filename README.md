# Flappy Bernie JavaScript App

Flappy Bernie is a JavaScript web game that is based off of the popular game Flappy Bird.

You can find the corresponding backend project at URL(https://github.com/kotomino/flappy-bernie-frontend)

### Game Rules
Press the spacebar to flap Bernie up and navigate him through the pipes. The pair of pipes have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Bernie will descend automatically and the pipes' horizontal speed will remain constant. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes gains you one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the game. Happy flapping!
